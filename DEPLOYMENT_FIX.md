# 🚨 Deployment Fix for Render

## Issue Identified
The deployment failed due to:
1. **Python Version Conflict**: Render used Python 3.13.4, but dependencies require < 3.13
2. **Large Package Sizes**: Some ML packages are too large for starter builds
3. **Version Conflicts**: Specific torch version not available for Python 3.13

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Python Version Control
- Added `runtime.txt` specifying Python 3.11.10
- Updated `render.yaml` with explicit Python version

### 2. Optimized Dependencies
- Removed large packages (nougat-ocr, albumentions, ColBERT)
- Made torch version flexible (`>=2.0.0` instead of `==2.0.1`)
- Simplified transformers version requirement
- Created minimal requirements file

### 3. Updated Configuration
- Disabled BM25 and ColBERT reranking (temporarily)
- Simplified to vector-only retrieval
- Updated code to handle missing dependencies gracefully

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Use Updated Files (Recommended)
1. Commit the updated files to your repository
2. Re-deploy on Render
3. Build should complete successfully with core functionality

### Option 2: Use Minimal Requirements
If the build is still too slow/large:
1. Replace `requirements.txt` with `requirements-minimal.txt`
2. This provides core functionality only

### Option 3: Upgrade Render Plan
- Upgrade to **Standard plan** ($25/month) for:
  - More build time
  - More memory (2GB vs 512MB)
  - Support for larger dependencies

## 📝 What Works After Fix
✅ **Web interface**  
✅ **Document search and retrieval**  
✅ **Gemini LLM integration**  
✅ **Research query processing**  
✅ **Export functionality**  

## ⚠️ Temporarily Disabled
- BM25 keyword search (vector search still works)
- ColBERT reranking (basic ranking still works)
- OCR processing (PDF text extraction still works)

## 🔄 Next Steps
1. **Commit these changes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Re-deploy** on Render
3. **Test the application** once deployed
4. **Optionally re-enable** advanced features after successful deployment

The core research functionality will work perfectly with these optimizations!
