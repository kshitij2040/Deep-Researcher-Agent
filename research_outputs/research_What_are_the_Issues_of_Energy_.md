Research Synthesis for: What are the Issues of Energy Conservation in IoT?

Primary Analysis:
Several issues contribute to challenges in energy conservation within IoT systems:

*   **Idle Listening**: Nodes consume significant energy even when in an active but idle state, waiting to transmit data. During this time, they monitor their surroundings without actively sending or receiving packets. To mitigate this, sensor nodes can be configured to switch from a sleeping mode to an active mode after a set interval or upon receiving a wake-up signal.
*   **Collision**: This occurs when multiple nodes receive different data packets at the same time, rendering all the received data useless. Such collisions necessitate retransmission, which leads to increased energy consumption and higher latency.
*   **Overhearing**: During data transmission, interference can happen with neighboring nodes. This problem is common among nodes within proximity and results in the depletion of energy resources.
*   **Reduction of protocol overhead**: The information contained in protocol headers also consumes energy. To address this, methods such as adaptive transmission periods, cross-layering approaches, and optimized flooding are suggested to reduce this overhead.
*   **Traffic Fluctuation**: Variations in network traffic can lead to considerable delays or congestion. When the network experiences peak traffic while operating at its maximum capacity, congestion can escalate to significant levels.
